NOMBRE CLI: SP.22

Let us introduce you our model SP.22, based on data analysis and research of stroke,
which will allow us to anticipate its appearance, distinguish with certainty its causes, 
establish an early diagnosis and improve the treatment of patients.

From this knowledge base, SP.22 will develop a set of decision support tools for clinical level, 
to be used by healthcare professionals, and at the same time collects new data for future research.

se me ocurrio ponerle nombre al modelo SP.22 (stroke prevention y el 22 por el año en que estamos)
